  <h3>OpenDBM Data Guidelines</h3>
  <p>
    OpenDBM is meant to be broadly applicable to video and audio data. Given the plethora of possibilities in terms of what that data could contain, it is important to take certain guidelines into consideration before processing your data. This chapter outlines some of those considerations, which should help with experimental design, data organization, and analysis––all while ensuring a high signal to noise ratio.

## Helpful Videos

Along with the initial launch of OpenDBM (v1.0), we released a set of instructional videos as well as a recording of the training webinar we conducted. We want to add to how many of these we have, but below is the current list of videos that are helpful in getting started with OpenDBM.

### OpenDBM Installation on Mac

This video walks through the installation as described in Chapter 2; please note that this was made during OpenDBM v1.0 so there may be small differences but it remains a helpful visual guide.

### OpenDBM How to Use on Mac

This video uses just the required parameters in the processing script to extract digital biomarker variables from the sample videos that are included with OpenDBM and is helpful to anyone getting started.

### OpenDBM Sample Analysis

This video uses the data output acquired in the previous video to conduct a made up experiment to analyze some of the digital biomarker data in order to test a hypothesis.

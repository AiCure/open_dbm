# Google Summer of Code - Idea List

The purpose of this idea list is to help contributors answer the question:
> What are ideas of projects I can work on in OpenDBM <> Google Summer of Code? 

## Brief Overview
Choosing a project is a personal choice.  You should choose something you want to work on, and you would know that best! Here's a few questions you can ask yourself to help figure that out: 

- What software do you already use? 
- What would you like to leran?
- Who do you like working with? 
- How do you want to chane the world?
- How do you like to communicate? 


There are three primary project areas to consider for OpenDBM:
1. Docker
2. Pypi library
3. RESTful Api 


The community can benefit from a wide range of contribution to each project area, beyond the cardinal categories of feature enhancements, bug fixing, and optimization.  Because OpenDBM is includes a community of open scientists, jupyter notebooks, tutorials, and documentations are heavily important at our early stages of evangelizing, educating engineered.

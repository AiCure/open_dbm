Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatic facial behavior analysis
and understanding. We present OpenFace – a tool intended for computer vision and machine learning
researchers, affective computing community and people interested in building interactive
applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is the ﬁrst toolkit capable of facial
landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation
with available source code for both running and training the models. The computer vision algorithms
which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above
mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of real-time performance and is able to run from a
simple webcam without any specialist hardware.

OpenFace was originally developed by Tadas Baltrušaitis in collaboration with CMU MultiComp Lab led by Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency. Some of the original algorithms were created while at Rainbow Group, Cambridge University. The OpenFace library is still actively developed at the CMU MultiComp Lab in collaboration with Tadas Baltršaitis. Special thanks to researcher who helped developing, implementing and testing the algorithms present in OpenFace: Amir Zadeh and Yao Chong Lim on work on the CE-CLM model and Erroll Wood for the gaze estimation work.

# Final remarks

I did my best to make sure that the code runs out of the box but there are always issues and I would be grateful for your understanding that this is research code and a research project. If you encounter any problems/bugs/issues please contact me on github or by emailing me at tadyla@gmail.com for any bug reports/questions/suggestions. I prefer questions and bug reports on github as that provides visibility to others who might be encountering same issues or who have the same questions.
